It is a beautiful collection of stories, rooted in mystery and told through warm vocal melodies and catchy tribal rhythms. This is a truly unique and musically eclectic outfit, occupying the space between primitive and modern - acoustic and electric.<br/><br/></p><p><strong>EN GRAMMA</strong> is formed around lead vocalist <strong>Gautier Degandt</strong> who toured across Europe with his hard-folk duo <strong>BÂTON BLEU (Dixiefrog records/ PIAS)</strong>, Afro / Rock guitarist <strong>Oscar Philéas (MAMADOU KOITA)</strong>, and talented percussionist<strong> Pierre-Yves Dubois</strong>.</p>"
